Ming loves play basketball. 
However, most of his friend do not like this sport and Ming feels pretty lonely when it comes to doing sports. 
One day, when he was playing basketball alone on the playground, a stranger came and talked with him.

“Yo, wassup bruh!, what are u doin’ here? playin’ alone?” “As you see.” Ming shrugged. 
“That sucks! U wanna join us? I saw your shot. Bloody awesome!” “Bet, thanks tho, let’s go.” 
Ming followed the man to an abandoned factory. “Hey yo, come and meet our new brother!” 
The man introduced Ming to the others. “Boss, you bring a kid to us?” One of the fellows snorted. 
“Shut the fuck up! Are you doubting me?” The man shouted. For a moment, the air became stagnant. 
No one dare to make a sound. “He’ll prove it. Let’s see.” The man threw a ball to Ming. 
Ming caught the ball, frozen up nervously. “What are you waiting for? Come on, Prove him!”

His shot turned out to be disastrous. He was really sad.

"It's okay to feel sad sometimes
Little by little you'll feel better again

When you are feeling down
It's okay to feel sad
But little by little
You'll see it won't always be bad

It's okay to feel sad sometimes
Little by little you'll feel better again

It's okay to feel sad
And it's okay to cry
But little by little
The sadness will say bye-bye

It's okay to feel sad sometimes
Little by little you'll feel better again"
